    description:
      `After suffering devastating loss and making drastic decisions, Zetian finds herself at the seat of power in Huaxia
      But she has also learned that her world is not as it seems, and revelations about an enemy more daunting than Zetian imagined forces 
      her to share power with a dangerous man she cannot simply depose. Despite having vastly different ideas about how they must deconstruct 
      the corrupt and misogynist system that plagues their country, Zetian must join this man in a dance of truth and lies and perform 
      their roles to perfection in order to take down their common enemy,
      who seeks to control them as puppets while dangling one of Zetian’s loved ones as a hostage.`,
